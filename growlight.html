            Grow lights are special lights designed to help plants—or plant-like organisms such as algae—grow indoors.
            They give off the types of light that plants need for photosynthesis, especially certain parts of the blue
            and red light spectrum. Because they mimic sunlight, grow lights let plants grow even in places where there
            isn’t much natural light.

            In a Sea-Monkey tank, a small grow light can help algae develop on the tank walls or in the water. This can
            be useful because algae can act as a natural food source for Sea Monkeys. When the tank gets steady light
            each day, algae can multiply more easily, helping to create a little underwater ecosystem.

            Grow lights come in many types—LED, fluorescent, or full-spectrum varieties—but for a tiny tank, only a
            soft, low-heat light is needed. Too much light can overheat the water or make algae grow too fast, so using
            a grow light on a gentle schedule is usually the best approach.
