            A heat mat is a flat warming pad placed under or beside a tank to keep the water at a steady, comfortable
            temperature. Sea Monkeys (brine shrimp) grow best in warm, stable water, and a heat mat can help maintain
            that temperature—especially in colder rooms or during winter.

            Benefits of using a heat mat:

            1. Steady Temperature: Sea Monkeys do best around 72–80°F (22–27°C). A heat mat helps prevent sudden
            temperature drops that can stress or slow them down.

            2. Faster Hatching: Warmer, stable temperatures can help Sea Monkey eggs hatch more quickly and evenly.

            3. Better Activity Levels: Sea Monkeys tend to be more active, swim more, and grow faster when kept in a
            comfortable warm range.

            4. Healthier Algae Growth: If you’re growing algae as a food source, warm water can help it grow at a steady
            rate (as long as it’s not too hot).

            5. Gentle, Even Heat: Heat mats warm the tank gradually and evenly, unlike some lamps that can overheat the
            water from the top.

        <h1>TIP: Because Sea Monkey tanks are small, only low-level warmth is needed. The goal is gentle, consistent heat—not
            hot water. Using the heat mat with a low setting or a thermostat helps keep everything safe and stable..</h1>
