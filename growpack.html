            Sea-Monkey Growth Food is a special powder made to help baby Sea Monkeys grow strong and healthy. It contains tiny bits of nutrients, minerals, and algae that Sea Monkeys can easily eat. When you sprinkle the growth food into the tank, the small particles spread through the water so the Sea Monkeys can filter them as they swim.

The food is designed to match what brine shrimp eat in nature, giving them energy to grow, molt, and become more active. You only need to feed a very small amount, because the particles are so tiny and Sea Monkeys eat very slowly. When used correctly, the growth food helps create a balanced environment where your Sea Monkeys can thrive.

        <h1>TIP: It is easy to over feed baby sea monkeys, since they are so small, too much food could actually wreck the colony! Just make sure to stay consistent in the first few weeks, feeding around every three days. </h1>
