            Algae are tiny, plant-like organisms that live in water. They can be green, brown, or even red, and they
            grow when there is light, nutrients, and warm water. In a Sea-Monkey tank, algae often appear on the sides
            of the tank or floating in the water. This happens because the tank gets light from a lamp or window, and
            the Sea-Monkey food adds nutrients that algae love.

            As algae grow, they make the water look a little greener. This is actually good for Sea Monkeys—algae are
            one of the natural foods they can eat! Sea Monkeys (which are a type of brine shrimp) scrape or nibble tiny
            pieces of algae from the tank walls or filter the tiny algae particles floating in the water. It gives them
            extra nutrition between regular feedings and helps create a small, natural ecosystem inside the tank.
        </p>

        <h1>TIP: While adult Sea Monkeys can eat algae, BABIES CAN'T! So, if you want a continuing population of babies,
            keep putting in growth food. If you want to keep a colony of adults, it is not 100% needed to feed as
            constantlty.</h1>
