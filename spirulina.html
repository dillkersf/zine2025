            Spirulina powder is a type of powdered algae made from a tiny blue-green plant that grows in freshwater
            lakes. It can used as a replacement to growth food packets. It’s packed with nutrients like proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which makes it a great supplemental
            food for Sea Monkeys (brine shrimp).

            When a tiny pinch of spirulina powder is added to a Sea-Monkey tank, the fine particles spread through the
            water. Sea Monkeys eat by filtering small bits of food as they swim, so the spirulina becomes an easy,
            natural snack for them. It helps support their growth, gives them energy, and can even make the water
            greener—similar to the natural algae Sea Monkeys would eat in the wild.
        </p>

        <h1>TIP: Because spirulina is very concentrated, only a very tiny amount is needed. Too much can cloud the water or
            throw the tank off balance, but the right amount adds healthy nutrients that help Sea Monkeys thrive. ALSO, if you get spirulina pellets, make sure to crush them first!</h1>
