        I have a couple of ideas, but one idea is about sea monkeys (The little shrimp).
        I think it would be fun if my website kind of brought the user through a sea monkey world and maybe you can
        make your own tank and learn how to make good decisions to take care of them in the real world. Or maybe a sea
        monkey world you experience. I think I would
        want it to look very handmade and hand drawn. They style would be made from pens/ pencils/ colored pencils over
        a paper background? More about learning about and taking care of them. Maybe you can build your own tank.
        <br><br>
        Another idea I have is like a trading card pack where every time you open the website, you get a new pack with
        different cards. The cards would be random maybe they can have facts and lead to different pages I find
        interesting and you can see a "checklist" of things you can learn. Maybe you can see whats in the checklist but
        you can only learn the fact when you "pull" the card. You go back to the pack opening page because you can't see
        the fact until you open it from a pack yourself.
