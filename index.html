        I have a couple of ideas but one idea is about sea monkeys (The litlte shrimp)
        It would be fun I think, if my website kind of brought the user through a sea monkey world and maybe you can
        make
        your own tank and learn how to make good desicions. Or maybe a sea monkey world you experience. I think i would
        want it to look very handmade and hand drawn. maybe like pens/ pencils/ colored pencils over a paper background?

        Another idea I have is like a trading card pack where everytime you open the website you get a new pack with
        different cards. The cards would be random maybe they can have facts and lead to different pages I find
        interesting and you can see a "checklist" of things you can learn so you go back to the pack opening page to
        learn more about what you see. Like you can't see the fact until you open it from a pack yourself.
